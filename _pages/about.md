Welcome! I am a graduate student from Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, fortunately supervised by [Prof. Huaping Liu](https://sites.google.com/site/thuliuhuaping/home). Prior to my graduate study, I recieved my B.Eng. degree from [Tsien's Excellence Education Program](https://www.hy.tsinghua.edu.cn/hyen/Academics/Lectures.htm), Tsinghua University.

My research interest mainly focus on Embodied Intelligence, Robotic Manipulation and Multimodal learning. My previous works involves the navigation and mobile manipulation in embodied scenarios (AI2THOR, Habitat et al.). Currently, I am working in leveraging large pre-trained models in embodied intelligence. My ultimate goal is to discover generalizable representations for a wide range of robot skills.

I am currently searching for Ph.D positions. If you have positions in related subjects, please feel free to contact me.
